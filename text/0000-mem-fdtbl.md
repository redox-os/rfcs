# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This RFC proposes moving the file descriptor table objects, currently an internal array on the kernel heap, into userspace virtual memory.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The file table is currently stored as a resizable array, which all contexts contain a reference to.
This is inefficient.
First, POSIX requires that `open` return the lowest numbered available file descriptor, which along with `F_DUPFD`, is currently implemented in the kernel.
Although alternative interfaces could bypass this limitation, all calls to `open` will likely require an exclusive lock, which interestingly is one of the reasons Linux implements [io_uring-based non-legacy file descriptor tables](https://lwn.net/Articles/863071/).

Addressing file descriptors using memory directly will improve flexibility and resource management, and partially unify the concepts of address spaces and file descriptor (capability) spaces.
That would simplify pthread_create/fork/execve, and more importantly, allow relibc to use _invisible_ file descriptors, that will not be noticed by the program.
Additionally, it would be possible to swap out and CoW-optimize capability space, without implementing such features for the kernel half of the address space.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

Each context on Redox currently has a file table containing file descriptors, which themselves contain counted references to _file descriptions_.
Hereinafter, _capabilities_ and _file descriptors_ are synonymous.
This RFC only affects how descriptors are handled; descriptions are currently internal kernel objects, which are out of scope for this RFC.
Capabilities are defined as _unforgeable tokens of authority_; the _authority_ is the file description, whereas the _unforgeable token_ is the file descriptor.

Another grant `Provider` type will be added for capability memory.
Initialized pages will be marked present but only accessible by the kernel, and will thus indicate that it is a capability page.
Userspace is responsible for allocating these grants, using `/scheme/memory/capspace`.
The kernel should still ideally be able to distinguish between capability memory and regular memory, in order to avoid page table walks, on applicable architectures.

Hence, the address space will initially need to be divided into regular and capability memory, split at an offset of, say, 1 GiB below the top of the user address space.
On architectures that do not force kernel and user mappings to reside in different page tables (i.e. non-AArch64), it capability pages could possibly be stored in the kernel half.

The contents of these pages will be an array of pointers to the file descriptions.
These are currently `Arc`s, but it would be equally valid for this to be physical pointers to entries on scheme-specific file description slabs, and this is out of scope for this RFC.
Although both of these optimizations would be invisible to userspace, both swap and CoW logic will initially be disabled in the kernel.
The latter is easier to implement however, as it only affects writes to the capability arrays (when duplicating or opening file descriptors).

Provided the user address space is split, so that capability and regular virtual memory is fully disjoint, capabilities can be read directly from memory, using the existing `copy_from_user` mechanism.
Unless the capability pages are intended to be readable by userspace, on some architectures like AArch64, manual page table walking is still possible, and capability pages can simply be marked "ignored" to the CPU, usually offering sufficient bits for it to still store the relevant pointer.

## Affected syscalls

All syscalls currently taking `fd: usize`, will instead take `cap: *const usize`, pointing to capability memory.
Using non-capability memory will result in `EBADF`.
Analogously, using capability memory where regular memory is required, such as the buffer for `SYS_READ`, will fail with `EFAULT`.
Syscalls that can currently return file descriptors, namely `SYS_OPEN`, `SYS_DUP`, will instead take an additional argument `destination_cap: *mut usize`.
This also includes schemes attempting to receive files sent to them using `SYS_SENDFD`.

## POSIX

Relibc will need to store a separate array (or bit array) containing metadata associated with file _descriptors_, namely the `O_CLOEXEC` and `O_CLOFORK` (added in POSIX 2024) flags.
This array will be behind a lock, and will be used to implement _open(3)_ and `F_DUPFD`.
In addition, there will likely exist a contiguous virtual memory region reserved for capabilities, that can be populated at runtime.

Non-legacy software will thus avoid the locking cost of creating new file descriptors, namely the requirement for the lowest-numbered file descriptor to always be selected.
Relibc can for example use other pages for internal file descriptors, such as (future) capabilities for the current root namespace (dirfd), working directory (dirfd), or process/thread fds, where it would be beneficial to avoid polluting the POSIX fd space.

### Fork and exec

POSIX 2024 has added O_CLOFORK.
The behavior of fork is to retain all previous non-O_CLOFORK file descriptors, and the behavior of exec is defined analogously for O_CLOEXEC.
This will be implemented in fork by duplicating the address space as usual (including all capability pages), and then calling SYS_CLOSE(cap_ptr) for each O_CLOFORK capability pointer in the child process (possibly using a "close range" or "close indirect" syscall for performance).

Exec will close all O_CLOEXEC capabilities before entering the new program.
This does not change the O_CLOFORK/O_CLOEXEC fragmentation issue, since the kept file descriptor numbers must be preserved in the new context.
If all capabilities in a page are freed, that page can safely be unmapped, possibly automatically by the kernel (possibly limited when TLB shootdown is necessary).

## Architecture specific

This section assumes userspace will not be granted read-only access to the actual capability pointers, i.e. the capability pages will reside in kernel-only virtual memory.

### x86-64 and i686

On x86-64, the capability region will reside in a kernel PML4 reserved for capabilities.
All capability pages in this PML4 will be marked non-global and kernel-only, and will be switched as any other page during address space switches.
Reading a capability pointer will mask away all PML4-controlling bits, and hardcode the reserved PML4 index, resulting in address `x`.
When user protection keys are supported, it will AND the remaining address with a branchless value set to zero iff the 4 MSBs of `x` correspond to a set access/write bit in the `PKRU` register.
If the PKEY-derived mask is zero, the kernel will access page zero, which assuming SMAP is enabled, will always fail.
If SMAP is not available, it will need to check the address manually.

Similarly, on i686 a kernel PD will be reserved, allowing 10+12-2=20 possible capabilities (>1 million) per context.
This may be somewhat limiting, but on Linux systems this limit is by default just a few thousand, and exhausting this limit means 1/1024 of available physical memory (or 1/4096 if PSE is enabled), which is likely unrealistic.
Protection keys are obviously ignored in this case.

### RISC-V

RISC-V does not currently support protection keys without nonstandard extensions.
As it supports user and kernel mappings in the same page tables, it will function similar to x86-64 in the case where PKEYs are not available.

### aarch64

Unlike x86, AArch64 separates user and kernel page tables.
Storing capabilities directly in mapped kernel memory would thus necessitate switching kernel page tables in addition to switching user page tables, for every world switch.
Instead, part of the user page table will be reserved, and contain page table entries marked non-present, but where they will act as a regular radix tree walked manually by the kernel.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

This increases the complexity of the virtual memory system, in part due to the differences in virtual memory features, depending on architecture.
In particular, some architectures may require manual page table traversal (or some other data structure), which is likely slower than accessing file descriptor table elements directly.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

One alternative to allow _invisible_ internal relibc fds, is to simply use two file tables, or use another level of indirection for the POSIX file table.
Compared to the suggested approach, those would however be less efficient, and would suffer from increased complexity, in managing resource limits, and process API impls.

A viable alternative would be to keep the file table structure as is (or perhaps use a radix tree), and simply use an indirect file table.
Such an approach would both add additional layers of indirection, even more so if a generic radix tree is used rather than a global table.
This is thus a tradeoff between TLB and cache usage.
In the best case, translating between file descriptor and description will require only one (say 4 KiB or 2 MiB) TLB entry, whereas a tree walk would affect multiple regular cache lines.
Nevertheless, making these conclusions about performance is likely premature though, as benchmarks are necessary.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

KASLR is probably not worth aiming for in a Âµkernel, due to the significantly smaller attack surface area, and possibility for a formal proof.
So if KASLR is a non-goal, and there are no other security drawbacks from revealing physical memory to userspace, it would actually be possible to make these capability pages user-accessible readonly (and obviously read-write for the kernel).
That would allow checking whether sets of file descriptors intersect, which would be useful for scheme operations involving supplementary groups and file access control lists.
Otherwise, such checks would need to enter kernel mode, which would be slower.

For use cases like CRIU, a possible implementation might use restartable sequences during the short critical sections when the capability physical pointers need to be read, which would be interrupted if e.g. the physical memory is swapped.
In that sense, those physical addresses are the same type of volatile state as e.g. the CPU ID currently running a thread, or the x86 TSC.
The kernel can thus still disable userspace access to those pages, in this case even at page table granularity, the same way the `rdpid` value can be zeroed, or x86's CR4.TSD can be set.

Cyclic references will need to be avoided, since there exist file descriptors representing address spaces, which will themselves may contain file descriptors, if this RFC is implemented.

Perhaps the `Grant` abstraction could also similarly be eliminated, or at least reduced.
It would be possible to track the `Provider` of nonpresent pages using the remaining page table entry bits, and using the PageInfo for present pages.
The only exception is file-backed mmaps.
Maybe those could also be represented using file descriptors?

In this proposal, it is not allowed to use capability memory and regular memory interchangably, for some types of syscall arguments like the `SYS_READ` buffer.
Nevertheless, this would potentially be a very powerful abstraction especially for IPC, where existing syscalls can be reused to send and receive capabilities in bulk.
If a fused write-then-read syscall is introduced, this could replace SYS_OPEN (or "SYS_OPENAT") and SYS_DUP by specifying both a memory and capability buffer.
